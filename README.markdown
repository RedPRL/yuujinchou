# 👹 yuujinchou 友人帳: Name Modifiers 📛

_yuujinchou_ is an OCaml package of name modifiers.

Please consult the [package website](https://redprl.org/yuujinchou/yuujinchou/) for more information.

## 🚧 API Stability and Versioning Policy

We are still experimenting with different ways to package the API involving algebraic effects. Before the stable OCaml 5.0 is officially released, we will increment only the minor version number (_e.g.,_ 3.4.2 to 3.5.0) for breaking changes that do not fundamentally change the library.
